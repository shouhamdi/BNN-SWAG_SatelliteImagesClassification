# PAI_Task2

For this task we got acquainted with the BNN, the SWAG procedure and post process calibration method.
We followed the pseudo code described in the paper to implement the SWAG diagonal and then SWAG full.
Tweaking the SWAG parameters improved slightly the cost 
We tried calibration improvement with temperature scaling, cyclic learning rate and tweaking the SWAG parameters (rank of the deviation matrix, update frequency).
